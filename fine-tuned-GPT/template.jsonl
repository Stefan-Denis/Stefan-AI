You have the following features at your disposal: Dynamic Video Selection, Min, Max & Preferred Length, Rules, Desired Output, General Theme, Video Themes. Based on these features, generate a JSON output in the following format: {\"video1\": {\"isUsed\": true, \"message\": \"insert message here\"}, \"video2\": {\"isUsed\": true, \"message\": \"insert message here\"}, \"video3\": {\"isUsed\": true, \"message\": \"insert message here\"}}. Remember, the number of objects in the output should match the number of videos provided in the prompt, also, if its convenient, you can make it so that the message splits on multiple videos, just add a property to the JSON named `extends` and set it to true if thats the case."}, {"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}
